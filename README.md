# React Project — Food Table

Minimal React 18 + TypeScript (Vite) app that fetches foods.json and renders a table. Edit and Delete operations persist when the API server is running; a localStorage fallback is available when the server is not running.

- Development log: [DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md](./DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md)

Run (Windows PowerShell or CMD):
1. npm install
2. npm run dev
Open http://localhost:5173

Notes:
Development log from Copilot estimate a time between 36-56 min for creating this project. 
Edit & Delete fucntionality aren't performed as API base URL is not specified. Features like get foods into a table from json and edit pages along with delete alert are implemented.
